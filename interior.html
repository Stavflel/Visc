Since we're fighting, if you ever have an affair with that guy, I will come to the hotel room and blow my brains out all over your naked bodies. Well then get your shit together. Get it all together and put it in a backpack, all your shit, so it's together. ...and if you gotta take it somewhere, take it somewhere ya know? Take it to the shit store and sell it, or put it in a shit museum. I don't care what you do, you just gotta get it together... Get your shit together. Slow down!

Do you know how many characters there are in the Simpsons Morty? There's like a-a billion characters, M-Morty. There was an episode where Former President BUSH was their neighbor! You're our boy dawg, don't even trip. I am not putting my father in a home! He just came back into my life, and you want to, grab him and, stuff him under a mattress like last month's Victoria's Secret?! Rubber baby buggy bumpers!

Don't be trippin dog we got you. Don't even trip about your pants, dawg. We got an extra pair right here. Aw, c'mon Rick. That doesn't seem so bad. Wow I really crononberg'd up the whole place huh Morty, just a bunch a cronenbergs walkin around.

Don't Morty me! I tricked Rick into taking Dad on an adventure because I thought I could get a break from this kind of shit! But no! Like father, like goddamn daughter! You wanna be like Rick?! Congratulations! You're just as arrogant and just as irresponsible! They're robots Morty! It's okay to shoot them! They're just robots! Close. It's gonna make your kidneys shut down. Nice to wheat you!">
